# Open Library is an initiative of the Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3)
# non-profit, building a digital library of Internet sites and other
# cultural artifacts in digital form.

# Open Library has developed a suite of APIs to help developers get up
# and running with our data. We encourage interested developers to
# join the ol-tech mailing list to stay up-to-date with the latest
# news, or dive in with our own development team at our bug tracker or
# our GitHub source code repository.

# Open Library has a RESTful API, best used to link into Open Library
# data in JSON, YAML and RDF/XML. There's also an earlier JSON API,
# which is deprecated now. This is only retained for backward
# compatibility.
